quaketerm
======
**quaketerm** is a simple run-or-size Bash script for Terminator terminal emulator that makes the Terminator windows behave like a Quake terminal: 
run the terminal if not running, minimize if already running and rize if minimized. 

Usage:

```
$ ./quaketerm
```

##Setup:
Copy the quaketerm script to ~/bin (or elsewhere), chmod it to be run easily, make sure the terminator terminal emulator is installed (also wmctrl 
and xdotool for manipulating windows) and give it a try by running quaketerm. Setting up a hotkey (Meta-Q for example) is what makes the script 
actually usefull.
